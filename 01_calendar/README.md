### Total Points: 5.00

It's time to create a small version of a calendar app! Calendar apps have a few basic features such as the abilit to:

- Create different calendars for a specific purposes such as your personal calendar, family calendar, work calendar, etc.
- Create events on each calendar such as a work meeting, doctors appointment, etc.
- Create custom events such as Birthdates

Create the following classes using ES2015 Class Syntax:

- Calendar
- CalandarEvent
- BrithdayEvent (this is a subclass of the CalendarEvent Class) and contains the same property and access to methods as the CalendarEvent Class with additional properties specific to a Birthday.

Read through each TestSpec to gain an understanding of the instance each class should produce, the properties the instance has, and the class methods (the methods accessible via the prototype chain) each instance has access to.
